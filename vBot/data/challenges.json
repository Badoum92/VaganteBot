Zone\n\nThe year is 199X and you and your friends are crammed in your basement, stocked up on potato chips and carbonated drinks, excited to try the newest tabletop RPG ‚ÄúVagante‚Äù! \nYou hurriedly fill in your character sheets, anxious to embark on the epic quest to find the fortune and glory in the shapeshifting caverns on the outskirts of town. \nChecking the numbers one last time, you grab your dice, sip some cola, and disappear into another world‚Ä¶\n\nClassic 4 rune Vagante run! \nThe gimmick here is: this is an old-school version of Vagante where the current class trees don‚Äôt exist!\n\nThus:  YOU CAN ONLY LEVEL STAT TREES.\n\n** The only exception is your very first level up you get from Experienced. This can go into ANY tree. **\n\n(e.g. Rogue levels Acrobatics at the start of the run. But levels DEX, INT and LCK afterwards)\n\nScreenshot proof before ???‚Äôs Zone is required for challenge completion for all players. 1-2 should be fine\n\n* Liberal use of the dice emoji for rolling for fairies, spellbooks and loot is encouraged but not required!\n\n* Alternatively having a 4th player die twice and become a ghost to act as a DM is also allowed. C&A is all about having fun afterall! :-)\n\n",
